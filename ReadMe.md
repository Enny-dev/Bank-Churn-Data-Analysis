# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a bank's customer data to identify patterns of churn and suggest actionable insights to improve retention and service.

The dataset consists of 10,000 customer records, containing key demographic and financial details of bank customers. This dataset includes fields such as customer information (e.g., Name, Customer ID), financial performance indicators (e.g., Credit Score, Balance), and customer engagement metrics (e.g., Tenure, Number of Products, IsActiveMember). Additionally, it includes whether the customer has exited the bank or remains active.

## Key Questions
- What demographic or behavioral traits are associated with churn?
- Which customer segments are at highest risk?
- What can the bank do to retain more customers?

## Data Highlights
- Includes demographic info, tenure, credit card ownership, account balance, and churn status
- Visuals used: box plots, bar charts, histograms, and heat maps

## Main Insights
- High-balance customers are more likely to churn
- Customers without credit cards churn more
- High churn in Germany, and among older age groups
- Balance distribution is right-skewed; many have zero balance
- Tenure shows a non-linear relationship with churn

## Business Recommendations
1. **Improve Credit Card Uptake** – Promote to customers without cards
2. **Loyalty Programs** – Especially for high-balance or long-tenure clients
3. **Geo-targeted Interventions** – Especially in high-risk regions
4. **Review Inactive Accounts** – Investigate zero-balance accounts

## Deliverables
- PowerPoint presentation (10 slides)
- README summary (this file)
- Visuals folder for reporting

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
