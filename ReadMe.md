# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a bank's customer data to identify patterns of churn and suggest actionable insights to improve retention and service.

## Key Questions
- What demographic or behavioral traits are associated with churn?
- Which customer segments are at highest risk?
- What can the bank do to retain more customers?

## Data Highlights
- Includes demographic info, tenure, credit card ownership, account balance, and churn status
- Visuals used: box plots, bar charts, histograms, and heat maps

## Main Insights
- High-balance customers are more likely to churn
- Customers without credit cards churn more
- High churn in Germany, and among older age groups
- Balance distribution is right-skewed; many have zero balance
- Tenure shows a non-linear relationship with churn

## Business Recommendations
1. **Improve Credit Card Uptake** – Promote to customers without cards
2. **Loyalty Programs** – Especially for high-balance or long-tenure clients
3. **Geo-targeted Interventions** – Especially in high-risk regions
4. **Review Inactive Accounts** – Investigate zero-balance accounts

## Deliverables
- PowerPoint presentation (10 slides)
- README summary (this file)
- Visuals folder for reporting

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
